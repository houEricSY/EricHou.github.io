title: "Neural Motion Graph"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/paper-3
excerpt: 'Deep learning techniques have been employed to design a controllable human motion synthesizer. Despite their potential, however, designing a neural network-based motion synthesis that enables flexible user interaction, fine-grained controllability, and the support of new types of motions at reduced time and space consumption costs remains a challenge.'

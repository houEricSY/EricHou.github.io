excerpt: 'Deep learning techniques have been employed to design a controllable human motion synthesizer. Despite their potential, however, designing a neural network-based motion synthesis that enables flexible user interaction, fine-grained controllability, and the support of new types of motions at reduced time and space consumption costs remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, a neural motion graph, that addresses the challenge by enabling scalability to new motions while using compact neural networks. Our approach represents each type of motion with a separate neural node to reduce the cost of adding new motion types. In addition, designing a separate neural node for each motion type enables task-specific control strategies and has greater potential to achieve a high-quality synthesis of complex motions, such as the Mongolian dance. Furthermore, a single transition network, which acts as neural edges, is used to model the transition between two motion nodes. The transition network is designed with a lightweight control module to achieve a fine-grained response to user control signals. Overall, the design choice makes the neural motion graph highly controllable and scalable. In addition to being fully flexible to user interaction through high-level and fine-grained user-control signals, our experimental and subjective evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed approach, neural motion graph, outperforms state-of-the-art human motion synthesis methods in terms of the quality of controlled motion generation.

title: "A Two-part Transformer Network for Controllable Motion Synthesis"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/paper-3
excerpt: 'Although part-based motion synthesis networks have been investigated to reduce the complexity of modeling heterogeneous human motions, their computational cost remains prohibitive in interactive applications. To this end, we propose a novel two-part transformer network that aims to achieve high-quality, controllable motion synthesis results in real-time. Our network separates the skeleton into the upper and lower body parts, reducing the expensive cross-part fusion operations, and models the motions of each part separately through two streams of auto-regressive modules formed by multi-head attention layers. However, such a design might not sufficiently capture the correlations between the parts. We thus intentionally let the two parts share the features of the root joint and design a consistency loss to penalize the difference in the estimated root features and motions by these two auto-regressive modules, significantly improving the quality of synthesized motions. After training on our motion dataset, our network can synthesize a wide range of heterogeneous motions, like cartwheels and twists. Experimental and user study results demonstrate that our network is superior to state-of-the-art human motion synthesis networks in the quality of generated motions.'

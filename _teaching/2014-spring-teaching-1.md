Iâ€˜m responsible for the human segmentation algorithm module in the company's "Smart Canteen" project. It was successfully applied to the company's products, and the algorithm was optimized and deployed to the cloud for display on the company's official website.
I also participated in the company's virtual human project as a core personnel, mainly responsible for the research and development of algorithms related to human motion generation. Related results helped optimize the company's motion capture system and were used in products as the cornerstone of subsequent virtual human motion generation algorithms.
